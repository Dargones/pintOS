CMSC 326
Design Document for Project #1: Alarms and Priority Scheduling with Priority Donation
Due: 28.March.2018

This plain text file should be called Project1_Design.txt and it should be completed and uploaded on Moodle.

Your submission will receive 50% of its points based on how well it passes my tests.  The remaining 50% is divided between the design document and your code quality.  The latter includes commenting, clarity, consistency with the Pintos style, and efficiency (in that order).

---- PRELIMINARIES ----

If you have any preliminary comments on your submission, notes for the TAs, or extra credit, please give them here.

Please cite any offline or online sources you consulted while preparing your submission, other than the Pintos documentation, course text, and notes provided by the instructor.



---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.  Precede each by its directory and file name.

src/threads/synch.h (SAMPLE)
A "latch" is a new synchronization primitive.  Acquires block until the first release.  Afterward, all ongoing and future acquires pass immediately.

    /* Latch. */
    struct latch 
      {
        bool released;              /* Released yet? */
        struct lock monitor_lock;   /* Monitor lock. */
        struct condition rel_cond;  /* Signaled when released. */
      };

---- ALGORITHMS ----

How is priority scheduling implemented?  Refer critical data structures and the procedures where they are modified.

Briefly describe your implementation of lock_acquire.

Briefly describe your implementation of lock_release.

How do you deal with multiple locks?

How do you deal with nested locks?


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

How do you avoid race conditions within lock_acquire and lock_release?



---- RATIONALE ----

Critique your design, pointing out advantages and disadvantages in
your design choices.
